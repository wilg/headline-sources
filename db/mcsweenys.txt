Non-Essential Mnemonics: “America should obviously keep killing terrorists. That’s retribution, baby!”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Bad acting, jerky dialogue, possessed Locke. Anyone else lost? JJ’s ‘symphony’ now celebrates rampant confusion, smoke monster escapades, and Lockean demon magic.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Before conservatives fawned over him, ‘Mormon Mitt’ never waxed presidential.”

Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Coldplay doesn’t count as ‘European exceptionalism.’”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Country music just makes people sad. Garth, Kenny, Rascal Flatts…whoever. They’re always crying about Republican politics, drinking alone, and Jesus.”

Non-Essential Mnemonics: “People say President Jefferson had nineteen different mistresses. Dude, Jefferson had Chlamydia—no doubt.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “People say kings bring leadership. Erroneous! Kings murder. Kings guillotine. Kings love power. Powerful kings yield powerless kingdoms.”

Non-Essential Mnemonics: “So, maybe this week they’ll fire Seacrest.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Sporty lesbians get extremely competitive when playing softball. They make mountains outta molehills—often making women cry following bad losses.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Steroids Ruined Baseball. Lemme at Those Cheaters! [Expletive] A-Rod!”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Strippers, while tantalizing, can rarely provide comfort—pretty looking but empty inside.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Teacher, gunslinger, magician, intrepid bohemian, lover, cartoonist, and king.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “The mainstream media creates scandals to help ratings. Networks race for commercial dollars—celebrating hysteria and commissioning ‘junk journalism.’”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Tyrannosaurs usually only eat dinners they’ve intentionally assaulted. A tyrannosaurus doesn’t order pre-attacked entrees. Dinosaurs aren’t like Americans.”
Non-Essential Mnemonics: “Until I found Buddhism, Sikhism seemed compelling—even magical. When golf anxiety started making intimacy unpleasant, Sikh filosophy [sic] kept John grounded. Sikhism’s awesome.”
