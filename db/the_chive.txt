I call it the Power Tush
I call it the “Kissing-Bomb” for obvious reasons
I can always think of Bad Ideas for the Weekend
I can barely stand work anymore
I can see the resemblance
I can see the weekend and now I just DGAF
I can see the weekend, and now I just DGAF

I never knew tanning could be so creatively stupid
I never saw this coming: unmanned vehicles with women on laptops
I never thought I’d say this, but these are some badass golfers 
I often sit and wonder if the course of history would’ve changed if yoga pants existed throughout time
I openly concede that this girl could whoop my ass
I pledge allegiance to the camera phone
I pray that this pizza delivery guy is the exception and not the norm 
I predict lower back problems in their future
I read this on the internet, therefore, it is true
I really do miss college
I really like where this is going

I wish I could’ve been on set for some of these magical movie moments
I wish I could’ve been there for these beautiful moments
I wish I was taking your selfies
I wish I were half as smart as the geniuses behind all this
I wish I’d been there for these beautiful moments
I wish everyday was an epic pool party water slide extravaganza 
I wish laughing was a sport
I wish my college had an Alaina
I wish summer would never end
I wish they weren’t, but some things are just too true
I wish they weren’t, but these things are all just too true
I won’t say dumb blondes. I will say blonde Fails
I wore that?!
I would give up my entire Pog collection to date a gorgeous redhead
I would love for this girl to just destroy me 
I would tremble just being in the presence of the geniuses behind all this
I wouldn’t mind the hassle of moving for one of these pads
I would’ve loved to have been there for these beautiful moments
I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords
